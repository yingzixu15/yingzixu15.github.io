# Bonjour / Hi! :wave:
My name is Yingzi Xu, I am a MSc student in computer science at McGill University at Montreal, QC, Canada. 

My research is focused on integer parameter estimation, which is a theoretical field commonly applied in wireless communication. My supervisor is [Prof. Xiao-Wen Chang](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~chang/) at McGill University. 

Outside of research, I am also interested in data science and web development. I love the fields where I can apply mathematics and see the wonder it does. 

This is the place where I present some of my projects outside of school. It's still a work in progress.
