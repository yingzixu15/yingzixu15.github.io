# About me

My name is Yingzi Xu （徐瑛梓） and I am from Qingdao, China. Some of you might know the famous TsingTao beer from there! If you ever have a chance to visit, please try the fresh beer coming out of a barrel. I promise you won't regret it. 

I am currently a graduate student in computer science at McGill University. I majored in applied mathematics in my undergraduate study, therefore I have a decent background in math. My current research is also on the theoretical side of computer science, which can be read as "more math than coding", but it have lots of real-world applications such as wireless communication, 5G being part of it. 

This does not mean I am bad at coding or I am a bad developer. I love exploring new tools and frameworks. I enjoy the process of figuring out how to use a new tool by reading the documentations, watching YouTube tutorials, and browsing through StackOverflow to debug my own program. I learned Spring Framework this way, and I am in the process of learning Jekyll currently. In fact, this personal website is a toy project for learning Jekyll and HTML. I am still in the process of adding new content to this website, meaning I am still learning how to use different functionalities of this tool and fully enjoying the process. 

I am currently residing in Montreal, Canada, and I plan to stay here in the foreseeable future. And I am in the process of learning French! I aim to reach a functional level within the next year or two. 

Before coming to Canada for college, I studied in Wales, UK for two years for my high school education. I was aiming at medical school at that time, which unfortunately didn't work out after trying for two consecutive years. However at this day I can't say for sure that it was not a bless. I am enjoying the field I am in right now, and I love what I'm doing with all of my heart. 

Below are some miscellaneous facts about me:

-  I speak Mandarin Chinese as my mother language, and my English is at professional level. I speak okay Japanese and broken French - I am working on improving my French skill!
- I am a proud mom of a cute crested gecko named Kiss.
- I spend probably way too much time looking at cat pictures on Reddit. However I am quite interested in some ways Reddit works, and a few of my data science project ideas are related to Reddit. 
- I'm not sure how I feel about today's machine learning, especially deep learning. I think we lack understanding on how it works on the theoretical level, and we are to some extent using it extensively without clearly knowing how and why it works. But, we also often say the results speak for themselves. The extraordinary performance of deep learning technologies may simply just keep on and prove me worrying for nothing in the next couple of decades. 

I am still working on this website, therefore I will come back and update this section from time to time. Feel free to reach out to me through my email!
