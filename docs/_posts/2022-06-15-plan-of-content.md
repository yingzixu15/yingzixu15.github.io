I plan to put two series of blog posts here. The first one is some data science toy projects to practice my data science skills with. Given the static nature of Jekyll, I don't plan to use anything interactive here, but I may run a separate cloud server instance to toy with some Spring Boot API or interactive data visualisation, and integrate them as part of this blog series. 

The second one is more of a passion project for me. I want to write a blog series to demystify some of the buzzwords in the IT industry nowadays. On the top of my head, the first few I would like to write about are: 
- Machine learning and deep learning
- Artificial intelligence
- Crypto and cryptocurrency
- Blockchain

The goal is to clarify for people what are those companies actually saying when they say those words in their conference, events and ad pamplets. Especially now it's almost becoming a meme that "everything uses machine learning", but how many people outside of tech (who make up a huge proportion of the consumers of such projects, more often than not) really understands what they mean? There are also fear and confusion around these words. And my goal is to explain, using easy-to-understand language to people who are not tech geeks, what they actually stand for.
